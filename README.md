- Procedural Programming
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble, Merge, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Object Oriented Programming
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Binary Trees

## Technologies (I) Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC / g++ 
- **IDE:** Geany, QtCreator & VSC
